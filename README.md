This is the github page for the preprint: 
_Not by systems alone: replicability assessment of disease expression signals_
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/26/128439

It contains two parts. The first is a method to pick out co-expression modules  [(clusters)](https://github.com/sarbal/redBlocks/blob/master/clusters/) and the second is the disease recurrence analysis approach [(outliers)](https://github.com/sarbal/redBlocks/blob/master/outliers/).
